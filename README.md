### Plan for first iteration:
- Fix anything that is broken/janky, ensure runs as expected
- Make simple and logical layout
- Grid of small videos - click on one to show full screen
- Back button to go back to grid


### Changelog/Checklist
- No of buttons created = no of compatible vids in folder - scrollable list
- Removed shuffling of thumbnails - everything seems to run as it should
- Starting layout created


### To Do
- Full screen player
- Play, pause, fast forward/backward, maybe something to skip 10 secs each way like youtube app?
- Volume control
