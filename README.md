### Plan for first iteration:
- Fix anything that is broken/janky, ensure runs as expected
- Make simple and logical layout
- Grid of small videos - click on one to show full screen
- Back button to go back to grid

### Done in first iteration:
- Everything runs ok, still a few v.small bugs
- Stopped thumbnails shuffling
- First simple layout done

### Plan for second iteration: 
- Grid view -> Fullscreen Video
- Play, pause, change speed, transport bar, volume - vids do have sound, just default set to 0
- Maybe some sketches, design for desktop and mobile

### Done in second iteration:
- No of buttons created = no of compatible vids in folder - scrollable list
- Grid view -> Fullscreen Video
- Play, pause, change speed, transport bar, volume - vids do have sound, just default set to 0
- Next/prev video buttons - non functional

### Plan for third iteration: 
- Use icons for the player buttons
- Add volume icon
- Fix next/prev video
- Polish general appearance - grid view, could do with making look pretty
- Fix bits and pieces that don't work/work a bit funny
- Different responsive layout for tablet/phone??
