### Plan for first iteration:
- Fix anything that is broken/janky, ensure runs as expected
- Make simple and logical layout
- Grid of small videos - click on one to show full screen
- Back button to go back to grid


### Changelog/Checklist
- No of buttons created = no of compatible vids in folder
- Removed shuffling of thumbnails - everything seems to run as it should

### Still To Do - Tom 
- Code is hella ugly and disorganised - make it more modular and improve the layout, remove messy comments (maybe remove comments at end?) 
- Very little progress made on actual layout, sketch out first then look to implement - organising the code better will probably help with this; easier to read, more logical flow etc
- Figure out what is going wrong with the scroll area
